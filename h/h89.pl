/*** h89_do_while_time drops conditions from the concept definition 
**** of the passed parameter Concept. Each condition deletion results
**** in a new concept definition. THis process is repeated until the
**** allocated time is used up (Alotment). Each new concept definition
**** is displayed to the user to allow for it's renaming or deletion.
**** If accepted by the user, the new concept definition is asserted.
**** Note the trick for iterating through h89_do_while_time: the
**** predicate times_up FAILS if there is time remaining and
**** succeeds is the alloted time is used up. Failure forces backtracking
**** resulting in alternative paths through dropcondition. This
**** works since the effects of h89_do_while_time are achieved through
**** side-effects.

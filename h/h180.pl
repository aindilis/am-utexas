:-public h180/1.

/* h180 finds examples of the composite operation f o g by using existing 
   examples of f and g. First the examples of f and g are gathered. Then a 
   matching pair is sought such that g's range(output) equals f's domain
   (input). This suggests that an example of f o g is [g's domain,f's range].
   Search proceeds by failure (of times_up) and backtracking.
   A task is added to the agenda to check the new examples(note that although
   addtoagenda may be called many times, only one task is created because
   the reason remains the same). */

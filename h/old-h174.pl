/* h174 creates a new operation by composing two existing operations.In clausal
   form, the composition is expressed as fog(a,b,c,y):-g(a,b,c,x),f(x,y) which
   is equivalent to f(g(a,b,c)) in functional notation. First function f is
   checked to make sure that it has "arity" 2 (one input and one output 
   parameter). Next the lists of valid domains and ranges of the two functions
   are checked to find a valid composite domain-range. Then the new algorithm
   is created as a single prolog clause and is asserted. Finally a new concept
   frame is filled in. Note that this heuristic is not really very useful
   given the operations that we have defined; this is because very few of
   our operations are of arity 2 with one input and one output parameter. */
